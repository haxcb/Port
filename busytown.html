				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>Toontales is an interactive storybook platform housing episodic stories from different IPs, such as Busytown Mysteries and Caillou. The Busytown episodes were the first set of episodes to be released, and make use of a variety of playful interactions and minigames that are integrated into the story itself.</p>

				<h5>Design Process</h5>
				<h1 class="flushTop">Simple, Fast, Efficient UI</h1>
				<p>We set out to keep the UI visual style simple and efficient for a number of reasons.</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Adaptability to Change</h2>
				<p>Traditionally, mobile games use art heavy assets for the UI that can be a challenge to modify without completely reworking the majority of assets. Seeing as the pace of the mobile gaming industry is very quick, with new trends and viral hits emerging every few months, we needed to ensure that the game's UI would be easy to adapt to design changes during development and beyond launch. </p>	
				<hr />
				<h2>Content is King</h2>
				<p>With a clean UI style, we wanted to make sure we still had beautiful imagery within the game for players to appreciate. The UIâ€™s simplicity was deliberately  designed to be complimentary to the striking visuals seen in the background & character art.</p>	
				<hr />
				<h2>Less is More</h2>
				<p>With a variety of different game modes and trail modes, we needed to communicate these differences within the UI itself. We focused on representing the elaborate mechanics of the game as simply as possible to allow both hardcore and casual gamers to feel immersed in the game.</p>

				<h5>Design Process</h5>
				<h1 class="flushTop">A Living, Breathing Design</h1>
				<p>We focused on designing in phases and abiding to strict milestones with the design process. Overall, we were able to meet our deadlines on time and stayed on schedule with the UI design process. What was important though, was that we were able to stick to a schedule, as well as account for major game design changes that came to us midway through development.</p>
				<p>We handled change through a stepwise process. First, we would analyze the impact of the change, and document how it would affect the current state of the game. After analysis, we would scope the change to minimize the amount of rework to existing features, and then proceed to wireframe, mockup, and implement the change. We kept our process well documented and concise in our design specification, to create transparency within the team as to what the state of the design was.</p>
				<div class="center emph topSpace">We revisited our wireframes many times and were able to efficiently come to solutions that would minimize the impact the change would make across the game.</div>
