				<h5>Development Process</h5>
				<h1 class="flushTop">Animations Everywhere</h1>
				<p>The Busytown episodes were built by a small team of designers and developers, which resulted in a lot of overlap in roles. Although I was primarily a developer on the project, I also worked on a number of design-oriented tasks. We were given a multitude of tasks ranging from animating dynamic transitions between screens to developing tools and entire minigames.</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Transitions</h2>
				<p>Transitions between pages in the story make for a more dynamic experience for the end user - instead of watching a generic animation repeat over and over, the animations were designed to help progress the story forward. Often, entire backgrounds and assets had to be redrawn or modified for the page to be developed.</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Jiggle and Bounce</h2>
				<p>We built the episodes so that every foreground element could jiggle and bounce. We made use of the jiggle and bounce technology to implement more complex, nested jiggle animations. While nested jiggles were challenging to configure without crashing the app, they brought out the toy-like nature of the characters.</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Card Matching Game</h2>
				<p>The card matching game at the end of Busytown episodes was developed in close collaboration with designers to ensure the game experience integrated sensibly into the story. Providing the player with both visual and audio feedback were key in ensuring the experience communicated effectively to users.</p>
