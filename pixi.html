				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>Pixi is a 2D action platformer game centered around minimalism. The aesthetic, UI and mechanics of Pixi are unobtrusive and take the player into the next game as quickly as possible. As the game progresses, the player must pass increasingly complicated arrangements of obstacles.</p>

				<h5>Design Process</h5>
				<h1 class="flushTop">Cut the Fluff</h1>
				<p>A common pitfall in designing a game from scratch is to be overly ambitious with art, system design, story, and mechanics. Pixi accomplishes as much as it can with as little as possible. Our priorities were snappy gameplay, satisfying animations, and quick transitions between screens.</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>No Tutorial</h2>
				<p>We designed the levels to introduce challenge over time. The first level even removes one of the core controls (swap) and introduces it in the second level instead. Having a tutorial or explanation gating the experience went against our core philosophy of eliminating extraneous overhead - we wanted the player to jump straight into gameplay without any barriers. </p>	
				<hr />
				<h2>Fail Often</h2>
				<p>The game is designed to encourage the player to try again after failing. Restarting levels after failing is quick with little time wasted on transitioning between menus. This forces the player to channel their frustration with failing immediately into ambition to win again.</p>	
				<img class="norm" src="images/px/level-flow.png" alt="Flow diagram for the different game screens" />
				<hr />
				<h2>Prioritize Motion</h2>
				<p>We chose to focus on creating better animations and VFX instead of creating high-fidelity sprites. By doing so, the game feels polished even though the shape language is simplistic. </p>
